<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At 41, I bring a wealth of experience from the construction industry, where I work in project management, risk assessment, and project planning. My professional journey has sharpened my skills in strategizing, managing intricate projects, and ensuring that every detail is meticulously planned and executed. This background has not only equipped me with technical expertise but also with the resilience and problem-solving abilities that come with years of hands-on experience.</p>

<p>Recently, I've found myself drawn to a new passion: web development. Fascinated by the ever-evolving digital landscape, I see web development as the perfect blend of creativity and technical innovationâ€”a career path that offers endless opportunities for growth and exploration. This transition represents a bold step towards merging my analytical background with a field that continuously challenges and inspires me, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, my life is enriched by my wonderful family. I am the proud parent of two energetic sons, Alexandru, 9, and Radu, 5, both of whom share a love for football and an active, vibrant spirit. Our home is complete with the playful companionship of our Labrador, Mason, and our inquisitive Bengal cat, Aqua, who add a delightful mix of energy and charm to our everyday life.</p>
